# Runnerfuze

A web application for runners who want to share their runs.

I wanted to build this app because I thought it would be fun to be able to see runners before and after run photos of either themselves or their environments that they run in. I believe it would be inspiring to see all the cool places in the world people are able to exercise. There is also some humor and/or inspiration that comes from seeing someone right after running a really tough workout, sweaty and tired.
